Data is being used to create more efficient systems and this is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a type of information filtering systems as they improve the quality of search results and provides items that are more relevant to the search item or are realted to the search history of the user.\n\nThey are used to predict the rating or preference that a user would give to an item. Almost every major tech company has applied them in some form or the other: Amazon uses it to suggest products to customers, YouTube uses it to decide which video to play next on autoplay, and Facebook uses it to recommend pages to like and people to follow. Moreover, companies like Netflix and Spotify depend highly on the effectiveness of their recommendation engines for their business and success.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Learning Objective\n\nLearn from data and recommend best TV shows to users, based on self & others behaviour.\n\nhere are basically three types of recommender systems:-\n\n- **Demographic Filtering**- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.\n- **Content Based Filtering**- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.\n- **Collaborative Filtering**- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data loading\n\nThe first dataset contains the following features:-\n\n- movie_id -

There are several candidates for this; such as the euclidean, the Pearson and the [cosine similarity scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). There is no right answer to which score is the best. Different scores work well in different scenarios and it is often a good idea to experiment with different metrics.\n\nWe will be using the cosine similarity to calculate a numeric quantity that denotes the similarity between two movies.

It is only capable of suggesting movies which are close to a certain movie. That is, it is not capable of capturing tastes and providing recommendations across genres.\n\nAlso, the engine that we built is not really personal in that it doesn't capture the personal tastes and biases of a user. Anyone querying our engine for recommendations based on a movie will receive the same recommendations for that movie, regardless of who she/he is.\n\nTherefore, in this section, we will use a technique called Collaborative Filtering to make recommendations to Movie Watchers.\nIt is basically of two types:-\n\n*  **User based filtering**-  These systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For measuring the similarity between two users we can either use pearson correlation or cosine similarity. This filtering technique can be illustrated with an example. In the following matrixes, each row represents a user, while the columns correspond to different movies except the last one which records the similarity between that user and the target user. Each cell represents the rating that the user gives to that movie. Assume user E is the target.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*9NBFo4AUQABKfoUOpE3F8Q.png)\n\nSince user A and F do not share any movie ratings in common with user E, their similarities with user E are not defined in Pearson Correlation. Therefore, we only need to consider user B, C, and D. Based on Pearson Correlation, we can compute the following similarity.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*jZIMJzKM1hKTFftHfcSxRw.png)\n\nFrom the above table we can see that user D is very different from user E as the Pearson Correlation between them is negative. He rated Me Before You higher than his rating average, while user E did the opposite. Now, we can start to fill in the blank for the movies that user E has not rated based on other users.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*9TC6BrfxYttJwiATFAIFBg.png)\n\nAlthough computing user-based CF is very simple, it suffers from several problems. \n- One main issue is that users’ preference can change over time. \n- It indicates that precomputing the matrix based on their neighboring users may lead to bad performance. To tackle this problem, we can apply **item-based CF**.\n\n* **Item Based Collaborative Filtering** - Instead of measuring the similarity between users, the item-based CF recommends items based on their similarity with the items that the target user rated. Likewise, the similarity can be computed with Pearson Correlation or Cosine Similarity. The major difference is that, with item-based collaborative filtering, we fill in the blank vertically, as oppose to the horizontal manner that user-based CF does. The following table shows how to do so for the movie Me Before You.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*LqFnWb-cm92HoMYBL840Ew.png)\n\nIt successfully avoids the problem posed by dynamic user preference as item-based CF is more static. \n- However, several problems remain for this method. \n    - First, the main issue is ***scalability***. The computation grows with both the customer and the product. The worst case complexity is O(mn) with m users and n items. \n    - In addition, ***sparsity*** is another concern. Take a look at the above table again. Although there is only one user that rated both Matrix and Titanic rated, the similarity between them is 1. In extreme cases, we can have millions of users and the similarity between two fairly different movies could be very high simply because they have similar rank for the only user who ranked them both.\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-21T18:52:24.661587Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-21T18:52:24.661973Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-21T18:52:24.716535Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-21T18:52:24.661936Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-21T18:52:24.715128Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Single Value Decomposition**\nOne way to overcome the problem of scalability and sparseness created by CF is to use a **latent factor model** to detect similarity between users and targets. Basically, we want to turn the recommendation problem into an optimization problem.\n- One common metric is the root mean square error (RMSE). **The lower the RMSE, the better the performance**.  \n- Now that we are talking about the latent factor \n    - It is a broad term that describes a property or concept that a user or object has. \n    - For example, in the case of music, a latent factor may refer to the genre to which the music belongs. \n- SVD reduces the dimension of the utility matrix by removing its hidden factors. \n- Basically, we map each user and each object to a hidden space of dimension r. Therefore, it helps us better understand the relationship between users and objects when they become directly comparable. The image below  illustrates this idea.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*GUw90kG2ltTd2k_iv3Vo0Q.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from surprise import Reader, Dataset, SVD\nfrom surprise.model_selection import cross_validate\nfrom surprise.model_selection import KFold\nreader = Reader()\nratings = pd.read_csv('../input/the-movies-dataset/ratings_small.csv')\nratings.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-21T19:17:38.700790Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-21T19:17:38.701161Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-21T19:17:38.760864Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-21T19:17:38.701131Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-21T19:17:38.759805Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":60,"outputs":[{"execution_count":60,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"   userId  movieId  rating   timestamp\n0       1       31     2.5  1260759144\n1       1     1029     3.0  1260759179\n2       1     1061     3.0  1260759182\n3       1     1129     2.0  1260759185\n4       1     1172     4.0  1260759205","text/html":"<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>userId</th>\n      <th>movieId</th>\n      <th>rating</th>\n      <th>timestamp</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>31</td>\n      <td>2.5</td>\n      <td>1260759144</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1029</td>\n      <td>3.0</td>\n      <td>1260759179</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1061</td>\n      <td>3.0</td>\n      <td>1260759182</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1129</td>\n      <td>2.0</td>\n      <td>1260759185</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>1</td>\n      <td>1172</td>\n      <td>4.0</td>\n      <td>1260759205</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = Dataset.load_from_df(ratings[['userId', 'movieId', 'rating']], reader)\nkf = KFold(n_splits=5)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-21T19:17:39.368488Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-21T19:17:39.368844Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-21T19:17:39.500458Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-21T19:17:39.368816Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-21T19:17:39.499538Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":61,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"svd = SVD()\n# Run 5-fold cross-validation and then print results\ncross_validate(svd, data, measures=['RMSE', 'MAE'], cv=5, verbose=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-05-21T19:18:38.341976Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-05-21T19:18:38.342367Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-05-21T19:18:46.339248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-05-21T19:18:38.342336Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-05-21T19:18:46.338260Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":64,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Evaluating RMSE, MAE of algorithm SVD on 5 split(s).\n\n                  Fold 1  Fold 2  Fold 3  Fold 4  Fold 5  Mean    Std     \nRMSE (testset)    0.8965  0.8945  0.8966  0.8986  0.8925  0.8957  0.0021  \nMAE (testset)     0.6917  0.6887  0.6921  0.6919  0.6898  0.6908  0.0014  \nFit time          1.46    1.21    1.10    1.08    1.05    1.18    0.15    \nTest time         0.58    0.18    0.19    0.17    0.17    0.26    0.16    \n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":64,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'test_rmse': array([0.89649334, 0.89449662, 0.89662059, 0.89863527, 0.89246596]),\n 'test_mae': array([0.6916833 , 0.68865143, 0.69208976, 0.69185038, 0.68979947]),\n 'fit_time': (1.4639065265655518,\n  1.213479995727539,\n  1.1017372608184814,\n  1.0843994617462158,\n  1.052720546722412),\n 'test_time': (0.5837528705596924,\n  0.1773984432220459,\n  0.1861743927001953,\n  0.17128300666809082,\n  0.17027807235717773)}"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We get a mean Root Mean Sqaure Error of 0.89 approx which is more than good enough for our case.
